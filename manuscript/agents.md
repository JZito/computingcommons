Here Come the Agents: An Economic Protocol Language for Programs (beyond humans)

In 1996, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Rajeev Motwani & Terry Winograd authored a paper describing the PageRank algorithm, that would eventually underpin Google’s rise to prominence. It made a simple inference. A site & the relevance of its information should be ranked higher if there’s more inbound links relative to the rest of the graph. It is more nuanced and has evolved substantially since then, but the core proposition is solid. Some information is more relevant if it accrues more references. This inherent graph existed before the advent of the web. Literary works had references in them, and one could build and plot this graph with some effort. Realistically, however it would’ve still been cumbersome to yield any useful results from it, and thus we had to rely on top-down systems like the Dewey Decimal system to organise our information.

The only way we could eke out a search engine based on a link graph was because of the web & HTML. It is an open graph. It allowed software to traverse this graph and create a representation of it faster than humans ever could. Society has changed forever due to this. Our understanding of information changed. It has made us all kings.

When we codified the relationship between information, we could let programs work at a pace faster than us and be able to handle memory on a scope far grander we ever could. The web is (relatively) free and open. It's a global system, where any one can connect a server to the edge and allow anyone access to the information services provided on it.

However, not much of the world's economic systems are as open. The informational backbone exists, but due to economies of scale & protocol designs, we still have silos for a lot of the interactions that happen in society. There's no open, really useful social graph, for example. As much as programs could in a permission-less manner crawl our informational artefacts, they can't easily dive into the silos that still exist.

Some silos aren't fully open, but do allow programmatic access, and one can see how it influences trade. A good example is high-frequency trading. Programs are trading away arbitrage between markets at speeds much faster than humans could. It's a lucrative game where investors have spent millions building satellite connections between New York & Chicago, as well buying up property close to exchanges in order to minimise the lag as much as possible ((corroborate)).

HFT have recently cause controversy, in that, although it introduces efficiencies into the market, it's not ultimately serving the humans in the corporations behind it ((why)). Companies like IEX, for example, introduce forcibly slower transactions to mitigate around this ((confirm)). It's an intense field and market, in which programs are running amok: playing faster and applying machine learning, ultimately leaving humans behind, except for long-term investing.

I would venture and say that HFT is indeed useful, but it's like racing lamborghinis in a courtyard. It's useful in the sense that allowing programs to partake in our world, faster than we can, can have positive externalities besides for the program owners.

At the moment, to allow programs to flourish and build systems that also benefit us (like traversing the link of the information graph to build search engines), there's a few things that need to fall in place:

1) We need more open database/ledgers/graphs that allow programs free reign to partake in.
2) We need to allow programs to not only read, but also write to.
3) They need to be able to do this without asking permission of a human.
4) We need to invent new systems where programs can co-mediate our reality with us. This means getting rid of some of the old economic systems.

The first 3 are likely to happen inevitably. This is a result of blockchain technology. Marginally, building blockchains will have benefits for humans and is the primary reason for their initial invention.   

### More open databases

The first part assumes that due to blockchain technology, more of what we build will gravitate towards them (rather than not). At the moment, it doesn't seem like a foregone conclusion. Here are some reasons why I suspect this will be the case.

1) Open platforms have time.
2) Upload once, run forever. No human maintenance.
3) Perpetually open source.
4) Scalability.

### Reading & Writing

As more information becomes publicly linked and accessible, wholly new opportunities arise for programs to crawl it and eke out new information. If one boils down to the web, programmatically, a hyperlink implies: <content A> is connected to <content B>. By reading what content A and content B as well as the overall position in the graph, Google could build its famous search engine. However, as previously states, there's a lot of very valuable information that is not being reflected in such an open manner, of things that are public. What's interesting about blockchains, especially ones like Ethereum, is that you can read them like The Matrix. There's this scene where ((name)) reads a string of numbers cascading down the screen. Since Ethereum updates are encoded, you won't be able to read it in English. It will look like gibberish, but they all mean something if you know what to look for. A good example are something like the currencies that have been created on top of Ethereum. They conform to a certain standard and all have the ability to transfer said currency to another address. That signature, the act of transferring is visible.

Over time, if you keep extrapolating, and transparency becomes more useful through a blockchain, more and more of the economy could literally be monitored, analysed and exploited to provide additional services. ((here))

This is an important part. The reason is that although only reading is useful (like what Google did with the link graph), but being able to write/co-create that graph automatically is also important.

When the web came out, we wondered what we will do with it. It made sense as a different publishing medium. People *could*, if they wanted to read their daily news from their home terminal. We envisioned the "information superhighway". It was mainly first regarded as another channel, another way to channel information to people. Human based tools

Inventing the new economic systems will be perhaps the most interesting past, much as Twitter or Facebook was unfathomable in terms of questioning how we share information. Many new economic models would likely not make sense at first (much like how the economic system behind Bitcoin does not make sense at first).

Ethereum . Token standards. Search for function signatures (for example). Search for voting signatures. Like reading The Matrix.

Not just about autonomy of agents. Whilst helpful (reduce requirement of profit)

The first company that can model the economic graph will be
