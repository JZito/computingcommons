Here Come the Agents: An Economic Protocol Language for Programs (beyond humans)

“The creation of language was the first singularity for humans. It changed everything. Life after language was unimaginable to those on the far side before it. - Kevin Kelly”

“One of the intriguing abilities that language users have is that of high-level reference (or deixis), the ability to refer to things or states of being that are not in the immediate realm of the speaker. This ability is often related to theory of mind, or an awareness of the other as a being like the self with individual wants and intentions.”

“...from the moment human beings invented language, biological evolution essentially ceased, and evolution became a cultural epigenetic phenomenon” - Terence McKenna

An incredibly important facet of of blockchain technology that few keep in mind is that we need to consider how this technology will be beneficial for programs, outside of the realm of human involvement.

In 1996, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Rajeev Motwani & Terry Winograd authored a paper describing the PageRank algorithm, that would eventually underpin Google’s rise to prominence. It made a simple inference. A site & the relevance of its information should be ranked higher if there’s more inbound links relative to the rest of the graph. It is more nuanced and has evolved substantially since then, but the core proposition is solid. Some information is more relevant if it accrues more references. This inherent graph existed before the advent of the web. Literary works had references in them, and one could build and plot this graph with some effort. Realistically, however it would’ve still been cumbersome to yield any useful results from it, and thus we had to rely on top-down systems like the Dewey Decimal system to organise our information.

The only way we could eke out a search engine based on a link graph was because of the web & HTML. It is an open graph. It allowed software to traverse this graph and create a representation of it faster than humans ever could. Society has changed forever due to this. Our understanding of information changed.

Since the web flourished we began to saw the establishment of new graphs, the biggest of which is unfortunately closed. Facebook has an extensive social graph, for example, which others aren’t allowed to traverse. This is closed information. By nature of how web was constructed, the information (HTML) graph needed to be open. Unfortunately, we don’t quite have access to other graphs such as economic interactions or social interactions that aren’t either closed or centralized. We have only managed to create an open information layer, but not much else. Interestingly, the original HTTP spec had an error code, called 402, that would be returned if a payment was required. Thus the intention was originally there, for a more richer graph to exist. The semantic web community started work on creating a richer open link graph, linking data together, not just documents. Ontologies were invented such as FOAF (Friend-of-a-Friend) whose purpose is to create an open social graph. Using the link graph for documents was an emergent phenomenon, as the documents themselves existed to share information. The existence of Linked Data, whilst useful is an afterthought to actively better categorise data, much like one would tag a blog post with some themes.

What seems to be lacking is public record of economic interactions & links. We’ve hacked the web to allow economic interactions to occur, but this is again through centralized institutions. For example, Venmo keeps track of who was paid & secondly, Visa, Mastercard, and banks do as well within their own systems. It’s all locked up information, unavailable to be traversed. Even if were open & available (perhaps anonymised for privacy), it would still be information owned and maintained by others, not fitting what we see with the web & information.

When one looks at Bitcoin

--

Bitcoin is a value-transfer language. One could try to infer. But it’s like following the trail and hitting the gates of a trade city at each endpoint.

Ethereum . Token standards. Search for function signatures (for example). Search for voting signatures. Like reading The Matrix.

HFT as an example of arbitrage automation. (IEX?). Limited usefulness.

Not just about autonomy of agents. Whilst helpful (reduce requirement of profit)

The first company that can model the economic graph will be

((leading on from graph discussions to prediction & graph markets))
