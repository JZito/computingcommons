Here Come the Agents: An Economic Protocol Language for Programs (beyond humans)

In 1996, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Rajeev Motwani & Terry Winograd authored a paper describing the PageRank algorithm, that would eventually underpin Google’s rise to prominence. It made a simple inference. A site & the relevance of its information should be ranked higher if there’s more inbound links relative to the rest of the graph. It is more nuanced and has evolved substantially since then, but the core proposition is solid. Some information is more relevant if it accrues more references. This inherent graph existed before the advent of the web. Literary works had references in them, and one could build and plot this graph with some effort. Realistically, however it would’ve still been cumbersome to yield any useful results from it, and thus we had to rely on top-down systems like the Dewey Decimal system to organise our information.

The only way we could eke out a search engine based on a link graph was because of the web & HTML. It is an open graph. It allowed software to traverse this graph and create a representation of it faster than humans ever could. Society has changed forever due to this. Our understanding of information changed. It has made us all kings.

When we codified the relationship between information, we could let programs work at a pace faster than us and be able to handle memory on a scope far grander we ever could. The web is (relatively) free and open. It's a global system, where any one can connect a server to the edge and allow anyone access to the information services provided on it.

However, not much of the world's economic systems are as open. The informational backbone exists, but due to economies of scale & protocol designs, we still have silos for a lot of the interactions that happen in society. There's no open, really useful social graph, for example. As much as programs could in a permission-less manner crawl our informational artefacts, they can't easily dive into the silos that still exist.

Some silos aren't fully open, but do allow programmatic access, and one can see how it influences trade. A good example is high-frequency trading. Programs are trading away arbitrage between markets at speeds much faster than humans could. It's a lucrative game where investors have spent millions building satellite connections between New York & Chicago, as well buying up property close to exchanges in order to minimise the lag as much as possible ((corroborate)).

HFT have recently cause controversy, in that, although it introduces efficiencies into the market, it's not ultimately serving the humans in the corporations behind it ((why)). Companies like IEX, for example, introduce forcibly slower transansactions to mitigate around this ((confirm)). It's an intense field and market, in which programs are running amok: playing faster and applying machine learning, ultimately leaving humans behind, except for long-term investing.

I would venture and say that HFT is indeed useful, but it's like racing lamborghinis in a courtyard. It's useful in the sense that allowing programs to partake in our world, faster than we can have positive externalities, besides for the program owners.

Ethereum . Token standards. Search for function signatures (for example). Search for voting signatures. Like reading The Matrix.

Not just about autonomy of agents. Whilst helpful (reduce requirement of profit)

The first company that can model the economic graph will be
