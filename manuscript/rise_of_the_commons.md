Something is afoot. You are, probably. You are either standing, sitting or lying down as you read this sentence. For those attempting to defy gravity, you might also be flying, hanging or just floating about.

In all these scenarios, there’s plenty of things taken for granted, for you to assume your chosen position. Standing on a floor. Sitting on a chair. Lying on a bed. Flying in a plane. Hanging from a bungee rope (for those times you just really want to read an article after you’ve flushed your body with adrenaline).

We trust the floor, chair, bed, plane & bungee rope (usually). We don’t generally question a chair’s capability to hold our weight. It’s no intervention at least. We have heuristics & an understanding of the world & its physics that allow to us to basically “forget” (from our perspective) those required internal mental processes.

It just works. This neat property of physics means we can build very tall buildings & float about in space stations. When we don’t have to trust the previous substrate to be obstreperous, we can generally assume that into the future things should be okay & we can build upon it.

From a social systems perspective, we’ve been building new foundations for aeons. We invent new systems that allow us to similarly “forget” the required internal mental processes to interact with each other. Everything we run to make the modern economy tick is built on things that were once new. Each time we invent a new substrate, we can forge ahead knowing we aren’t building on weak foundations: the chair isn’t made of paper.

Agriculture, Aqueducts, Steam Engines, Cars, Printing Presses, Double-entry accounting, Joint-stock Corporations, Cities & the Web. Countless inventions (big & small) that allowed us to push our social systems to grander scales.

Now we live in a globally connected world. Almost all adults have a smartphone ((check)) & products like Facebook have 1.55 billion monthly active users. It’s all unprecedented & we are moving further ahead. We are taking a new leap. We are globally connected, but we are still pretty much stuck with social systems from a pre-internet era. We are at the cusp of solidifying these grand new social systems of the new age. What new technology could take us further, allowing us to not just becoming a planetary society, but also eventually an interplanetary one?

If we take a look at history, and how we got here, it’s about continuously automating the internal social processes of society through technology. What would allow us to not rely on the crutches of national level systems: towards a society where we can trust others on a global scale? Or rather, where we don’t have to think if this chair is going to hold our weight? Where we don’t have to rely on figuring out if we can trust the chair or not? I can interact with anyone on Earth without having to rely on the mental processes to figure out if you aren’t going to abuse it.

Thankfully, there is such a technology that holds that promise: the blockchain. It ushers in the computing commons.

##The Commons

Before explaining just what exactly the computing commons is, it would help to explain the context of why the commons initially disappeared, how we created capitalism and how the rebirth of a new commons are upon us. There's been a lot written about this. Jeremy Rifkin's excellent Zero Marginal Cost Society gives and great breakdown on this (where most of this summary has been borrowed from).

The "commons" has an interesting history. It is normally defined as "cultural & natural resources accessible to all members of society". "They are held in common, not owned privately". Yes, this definition was taken from one of humanity's greatest cultural common goods: Wikipedia itself. In other words, it is resources that does not discriminate on who is allowed access to it. Different definitions have different ways of defining what is a public vs common good. Mostly, a public good is accessible by anyone, but sometimes requires governance to keep it that way (for example, a park). A true common good, is something that is available without requirement to maintain it so: like air. While usable by all (non-rivalrous & non-exclusive), common goods are sometimes subjected to negative externalities that is difficult to police (such as pollution). A common-pool resource on the other hand are resources which are accessible by any, but which's usage can potentially exclude others from using it ((example)).

Academics discuss the different definitions and where you must draw the line between. The important part here is that ideologically, a good that is designed to not be private & and whose access has little to zero discrimination can be considered to move into the domain of the commons. Wikipedia's content is licensed under ((insert licence here)) and it's goal is that it be shared & be accessible by anyone. Whilst some of these common goods have barriers to entry: requiring a flight ticket visit Central Park or requiring a phone with internet access to get knowledge from Wikipedia, the important part is the intent. It is a good whose purpose is to be shared & accessible to all.

Historically, the commons simply referred to natural resouces such as land. The understanding of the world and our position shaped how it was viewed. Land was God's creation, and there existed the "great chain of Being": each part fulfilling their role in it. After the fall of the Roman empire, Europe split into many isolated localities ((confirml)). Feudal landlords leased their land to peasant farmers under tenancy agreements: you can harvest the lands in exchange that I get some of said harvest. Land was aggregated and common. There were no fences ((confirm)). While it seems like the lords owned the land, it's important to remember that according to the chain of Being, only God had dominion over the land, no person had absolute lordship. The lords simply accepted their responsibility: to manage the land.

Two trends led to the eventual closure of the commons. A rising population caused food prices to rise. This caused general inflation which caused problems for feudal lords as tenancy agreements were fixed at pre-inflationary prices (that lasted normally for 3 lifetimes). An incipient textile industry also started growing and thus it became more profitable for feudal lords to close off their lands and start farming sheep instead. This uprooted the peasants whose outcome resulted in them having to sell labour instead.

With growing enclosures, people exchanged lands simply on how trustworthy they were. To facilitate this common law was eventually invented to allow exchange of private property. Strangers were then given tools to exchange private property, knowing police & courts would enforce it.

Combined with inventions such as the windmill & printing press, it eventually gave rise to the beginnings of the market economy and reduction of feudal power. Windmills using wind, could produce benefits from using the air (not able to claimed upon by the lord) & the printing press allowed commoners to exchange with each by allowing stored memory & written contracts. The first so-called "free cities" sprung up where the commoners were empowered enough to compete with feudal jurisdictions. Interestingly, it was said that if a serf could escape to a free city and remain there for more than a year ((check)), they successfully escaped, and moved jurisdictions to now be a free man.

##The Membranes of the Commons

Over time, as you can see, as ideas about the world changed (no more "chain of being") & as human populations grew, various incentives aligned to enclose the commons we once shared. To some extent, we mourn this loss. We would like to say that no human should be denied access to land. Refugees, running away from bloody wars, run into imaginary lines we drew on the Earth, denying them the right of searching for a better environment: for their future & their children.

On the other hand, the incentive structures that was built on the idea of sovereignty, private ownership & the market, catapulted society to where we are today. By some accounts, it was necessary if we believe that providing for a growing population is a moral imperative. A feudal economy with a commons ownership might have always existed if humanity's Malthusian libido was curtailed.

 In many ways, we wonder if it is in any way possible to have a society of 7 billion people otherwise? Arguably it can be said that the social costs involved to manage a natural commons stretching 7 billion people is just not possible with todays' technology. We might invent this into the future, and chances are we will (as explained in later chapters). For now, there's an understanding that the market could only occur if we allowed encapsulation to occur in the first place.

 There seems to be a constant interplay between allowing actors in a system to roam, versus closing it up. In some circumstances, it is indeed useful for actors in a complex to have their feedback loops curtailed. A soup of chaos, following only randomness, won't be able to congeal to allow the St. Grada Familia to spontaneously appear.

 ((Closing up, means control of internal processess))

 We see clues from different disciplines that closing up a free exchange between entities in a system leads to a new substrate of complexity. You wouldn't be here, reading this, if cell membranes didn't close up to house the organelles & cytosol. The birth of the cell marked the change in history from pre-biotic chemistry to partitioned units resembling modern cells. Cells, having enclosed chemistry, became simple replicators, providing protection from the outside & the confinement of biological activity inside it. It's uncertain how the first cells were formed. Some molecules can self-assemble into droplets that enclose watery solutions and provide different chemical environments inside it, versus the outside. These simple spheres are called 'protobionts'. Whilst not sufficient to explain the complicated membranes that exist today, processes involved could've lead to the evolution of the first cell & its membranes. What is important to keep in mind here that these organisms created new complexity by the fact it got enclosed. Keeping the internal components together, means that as a whole, the organism with its membrane, is able to not only survive, but provide a new a substrate: the existence of much more complicated systems such as life itself.

 When you see this pattern, it starts popping up in other disciplines. Ronald Coase, explains the existence of firms due to the fact that transaction costs in a full market reaches an inflection where it is easier & better in the face of asymmetric information, to rather organise as a firm: a collection of people working together, rather just a free market of contractors. Memetically, the firm is the cell membrane around an organisation's desire to fulfill a certain goal. The people, the processes, the tools (such as double-entry accounting & equity) is the internal cytoplasm.

The membranes around property, forced the creation of complex law systems, further creating ever deeper levels of encapsulation. Once one part becomes closed, it assumes that the layer inside it functions fine. A wall is only as good as the system it protects. Some theories about cell creation involves the idea of endosymbiosis. The internal parts of a cell were once independent organisms themselves. When banded together, hiding behind the first primitive cell membranes, more efficient versions evolved, causing these internal parts to shed generality for specificity.

Land, forming an important part of the market, is its own enclosed cell. Its internal processes once required it to house generality: people, homes, and different varieties of produce. New tools, technologies and processes start to replace these internal functions to specificity. Large tracts only grown with complicated & automated machines for only one purpose.

Similarly, in the market as a whole, starting with the fall of the feudal economy and the rise of the market economy, labour became more and more specialised. As humans, forced by the (inevitable?) unfolding of more complexity, the substrates grew ahead of us. We are relegated to perform more & more unique functions within the larger whole. As cliche as it sounds: we've become cogs in the wheel.

It is not meant in a negative way. We are the richest society in history. ((x amount don't live in poverty anymore)). Continuously, all parts are getting relegated to more specific functions. We don't have to till our own lands anymore. We just get to accept the Kingly nature we have landed ourselves in: like buying the latest VR headset for Christmas without really having had to anything of much to produce it.

##Technology & Solving Complexity

As time goes on, we see that technology is increasingly being swapped in to replace what roles we fulfill. Due to our capabilities as generalists, we can continue onwards, slotting into new firms, into new roles. From here on out, we see an inevitability arise: technological unemployment.

If we assume the same pattern, then at different levels of complexity, we partake currently partake as separate forces. The environment is capitalism, our membranes are our organisations and we compete & combine.

If we extrapolate on this trend, are there further questions we can ask. Could new membranes form under new auspices? And what does that mean?

We sometimes have this utopia in our head, that some time in the future, we will all be able to live peacefully next to each other. We've solved all issues of scarcity and live in an era of abundance. We can dedicate our time to whatever we want: sex, drugs or self-actualisation (or all of the above). We also often wonder how we get there. Often these futures seem to indicate we have let go of the shackles of that which got us here. It's an abundance, and often technology & machine production is often used as a reason. "It will do all our bidding and we can live like Kings". Whilst true to some extent, what I feel is often left out is that it is not just physical improvement towards abundance, but rather that we used technology to solve all the internal processes required in a capitalist system. There is no more margins or arbitration left for humans to do.

We solve the most efficient routes for delivery. We solve production & manufacturing costs. We solving pricing issues (internal & external), etc. What this entails is that we move towards a society such as what Jeremy Rifkin's describes: where is everything is zero marginal cost. And largely this is due to capitalism & technology.

Programs are infinitely better than we are. We can't store as much information, and we have pretty muddy heuristics to allow us to work more efficiently. We evolved things like stereotypes because it became easier to judge quickly and ask questions later. However, this comes at the cost where no knowledge of a stereotype could've resulted in an actual beneficial result. Programs don't have these limitations. And thus what we are starting to see is that it's use in modeling reality is being to the processes we currently deal with. A simple example is a decision support system, that collects & organises information for employees in an organisation to more quickly make a decision. On the other extreme, you have software like IBM's Watson that can diagnose a patient far better than any human can.

Combining all these tools, along with the continuous dive to zero marginal capitalism, results in a world where, strange as it may sound, the "market" as we know it, gets "solved". The silly, slow humans gets pushed out of all the tasks that make up the current industrial world. It won't happen immediately, and it will cascade through most of what we do. We now have truck drivers, whilst we know self-driving cars and the smart transport grid will just replace them. This is just not in the goods industry, in services as well. ((accounting, law, ai, etc)). As all these parts are replaced, in its stead we start to see what this world of abundance look like... a world where for example ((x)) amount of the world has access to a smartphone (a defacto super-computer in your pocket). We've already seen this happen at an informational level. We do not need professions such as scribes or messengers who deliver them. The domain of information distribution is now the domain of programs. Billions of devices, routers and lines, all negotiating messages with each other, send packets across the world.

What also start to happen as a result (and is already happening) is a large cultural shift. We all become casual producers on a much grander scale. We create global conversations on Twitter, we write on blogs, we take photos for Instagram. We produce more than a billion pieces of work belonging to the creative commons. When we aren't spending the time that makes us money to stay alive, we spend it, engaged in front of our devices. Continuously, there grows a disconnect between what we regard as valuable contributions to society & what we end up doing to make a "living".

((markets have overheads. reducing cost to interact -> re-introduction of new commons... eventually absorbing all competition. encapsulating it all.))

((perhaps emphasise growth of new terms of "commons"?))
